0.0.4 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


0.0.3 (2015-03-22)
------------------

- Embed ``File.source`` assets in fuselage bundles properly (instead of
  including them in the JSON payload).

- For SVN, always run EnsureDirectory to ensure can checkout to directory. Only
  svn co if no .svn directory. This will fail if directory isnt empty.

- Various python 3 fixes (thanks mitchellrj)

- Various OSX fixes.


0.0.2 (2014-10-06)
------------------

- ``Execute`` resources are now implicitly named by taking the command or
  commands parameters and filterning non-ascii non-alphanumeric characters out.
  For example, an Execute that did ``touch /foo`` would be implicitly named
  ``touch-foo``.

- Extend ``changes.ShellCommand`` so that it can be instructed to log something
  other than command.

- Clean up temporary files after execution.

- Add a ``ResourceBundle.from_iterator()`` convenience method. When used with
  generators it will throw validation errors at the point where the resource
  was yielded.

- Add a new ``ResoureBundle.extend`` convenience method.

- Add support for ``--simulate`` flag passing in fabric backend.

- Add support for ``Yum`` packages.

- Add a ``sensitve`` flag to ``File``, ``Line`` and ``Patch``.

- Resources that take ``owner`` as a parameter now default to the current user instead of ``root``.

- Resources that take ``group`` now default to the primary group of ``owner`` instead of ``root``.

- Fixed the ``Service`` resource.

- Add some more helpers around fabric support.

- Fabric bundles can be converted into Docker containers.


0.0.1 (2014-07-06)
------------------

- Initial preview release.
